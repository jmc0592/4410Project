# 4410Project

We are creating an Android application for our software development class. This app is meant to make shopping with multiple 
people(such as college kids going to the grocery store) much easier. It will display your "shared" items which you want to buy
with others together, and your "single" items which you will buy yourself. We plan to implement the cost to pay as well.
