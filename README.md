# 4410Project
We are creating an Android application for our software development class. This app is meant to make shopping with multiple people(such as college kids going to the grocery store) much easier. It will display your "shared" items which you want to buy with others together, and your "single" items which you will buy yourself. We plan to implement the cost to pay as well.

Note: The master branch is NOT the branch we will be developing on. We will be developing on the "develop" branch. In other words, all commits to be seen will be under the "develop" branch.
